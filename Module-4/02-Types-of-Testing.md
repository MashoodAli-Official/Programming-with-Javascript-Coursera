// Types of testing
Confirming that piece of software works as per requirements is called testing.
There are main three types of testing in JavaScript:
End to end OR E2E testing: This type of testing checks the entire application flow from start to finish, ensuring that all components work together as expected. It simulates real user scenarios and interactions.
Unit testing : This type of testing focus on small and individual components of the your software. 
Integration testing: This type of testing checks how different components of the application work together. It ensures that the interactions between components are functioning correctly and that data is passed between them as expected.
