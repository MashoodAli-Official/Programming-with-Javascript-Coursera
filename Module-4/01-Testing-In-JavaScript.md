## Testing in JavaScript
In JavaScript we can test our code using various frameworks and libraries.
There are many ways to write tests, but the most common approach is to use a testing framework that provides tools for writing and running tests.
Types of testing in javaScript include unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, functional testing, and performance testing.

### Some popular testing frameworks include:
