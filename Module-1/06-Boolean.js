// In Javascript Boolean data types are determined by two values: true and false.
// Like real-world example we can check the numbers greater than or less than another number.
console.log(5>4); // This will print true because 5 is greater than 4
console.log(3<2); // This will print false because 3 is not less than

// Another example of boolean values is checking equality is comparing two values.
console.log(100 ==100); // This will print true because both values are equal
console.log(100 == 110); // This will print true because 100 is not equal

// In Boolean we can also check the strict equality of two values.
console.log(100 == "100"); // This will print true because both values are equal but different types because one is number and other is string
console.log(100 === "100"); // This will print false because strict equality checks both value

// Boolean in javascript is also providing the ineuqality operator to check if two values are not equal.
console.log(100 != 200); // This will print true because 100 is not equal to 200
console.log(100 !== "100"); // This will print true because strict inequality
